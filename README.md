# Maze

This repository contains a simple 3D maze game written in Python using
Panda3D for rendering and PyGame for input handling.

## Running

First install the `panda3d` and `pygame` packages. Then execute
`python main.py` to start the game. Optional command line arguments allow
you to specify the maze width and height (they must be odd numbers):

```bash
python main.py 21 21
```

Use the **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys to move the player. Close the
window or press the escape key to exit.
