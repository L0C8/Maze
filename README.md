# Maze

This repository contains a simple text based maze game written in Python.

## Running

Execute `python main.py` to start the game. Optional command line
arguments allow you to specify the maze width and height (they must be
odd numbers):

```bash
python main.py 21 21
```

Use the **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys to move the player `P` around
until you decide to quit with **Q**.
